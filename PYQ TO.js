    correct: "Trans fats raise HDL cholesterol levels and lower LDL cholesterol levels in blood",
    description: "Trans fats raise HDL cholesterol levels and lower LDL cholesterol levels in blood. <br><br>This statement is INCORRECT with respect to trans fats. Trans fats have been found to have harmful effects on cholesterol levels in the blood. They raise LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol levels, commonly referred to as ‘bad’ cholesterol, which increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. <br><br>Additionally, trans fats also lower HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol levels, which is known as ‘good’ cholesterol that helps remove LDL cholesterol from the arteries. <br><br>The correct effect of trans fats on cholesterol levels is the opposite of what is stated in option (a). Trans fats raise LDL cholesterol and lower HDL cholesterol, making them detrimental to heart health. <br><br>Let's review the other options: <br><br>Small quantities are naturally present in dairy and meat fats: This statement is correct. Small amounts of trans fats can be found naturally in the fats of some animal products, such as dairy and meat. <br><br>They are stable at high temperatures of baking and frying, are inexpensive, and give food the desired taste and texture: This statement is correct. Trans fats have a high melting point and are stable at high temperatures, making them suitable for use in baking and frying. They are also less expensive compared to other fats, and they contribute to the desired taste and texture of certain foods. <br><br>Industrial trans fats formed when vegetable oils are partially hydrogenated are more harmful than natural trans fats: This statement is correct. Industrial trans fats, which are created through the process of partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils, have been linked to more significant adverse health effects compared to the small amounts of natural trans fats found in some animal products. <br><br>So, the correct answer is: a) Trans fats raise HDL cholesterol levels and lower LDL cholesterol levels in blood."

    description: "‘ It is equally effective even if muscle glycogen stores are insufficient at the time of slaughter’ - This statement is INCORRECT with reference to Electrical Stimulation as a technique for enhancing meat tenderness. <br><br>Electrical Stimulation (ES) is a common technique used in the meat industry to improve the tenderness of meat. The process involves passing an electric current through the carcass or specific muscles immediately after slaughter. While ES has several benefits, it is dependent on the presence of adequate muscle glycogen stores at the time of slaughter to be effective. <br><br>Muscle glycogen is converted to lactic acid during the early post-mortem period, and it plays a crucial role in the onset of rigor mortis. The presence of sufficient muscle glycogen is essential for the effectiveness of electrical stimulation. If muscle glycogen stores are insufficient at the time of slaughter, the beneficial effects of electrical stimulation on meat tenderness may be reduced or ineffective. <br><br>The other statements are correct: <br>a) The core attribute is its ability to hasten post mortem glycolysis: This is correct. Electrical stimulation accelerates post-mortem glycolysis, leading to faster pH decline in the muscle, which is associated with improved meat tenderness. <br>c) It reduces processing time and labor, as other processes can be carried out immediately: This is correct. Electrical stimulation allows for faster post-mortem processes, reducing the time required for aging or conditioning of the meat, which can save processing time and labor. <br>d) It accelerates the onset as well as the resolution of rigor: This is correct. Electrical stimulation hastens the onset of rigor mortis, but it also accelerates the resolution of rigor, which helps in achieving better meat tenderness."

    correct: "The form of iron used for fortification should be heme iron",
    description: "‘The form of iron used for fortification should be heme iron’: This statement is INCORRECT with respect to food fortification regulations. <br><br>Heme iron is not typically used for food fortification. Food fortification involves adding specific vitamins or minerals to foods to increase their nutritional content and address nutrient deficiencies in the population. Heme iron is the type of iron found in animal-based foods, such as meat, fish, and poultry, and it is already naturally present in these foods. <br><br>In food fortification, non-heme iron is the form of iron used. Non-heme iron is the type of iron found in plant-based foods, such as grains, beans, and fortified foods. It is the form of iron that is added to various fortified products, such as iron-fortified cereals or iron-fortified flour, to improve iron intake in populations that may be at risk of iron deficiency. <br><br>The other statements are correct: <br><br>a) Only micronutrients are used for the purpose of food fortification: This is correct. Food fortification typically involves adding micronutrients such as vitamins (e.g., vitamin A, vitamin D, folic acid) or minerals (e.g., iron, zinc, iodine) to foods. <br><br>c) Fortified processed foods should provide 15 to 30 percent RDA of micronutrients: This is correct. Food fortification regulations often set standards for the levels of fortification to ensure that the fortified foods provide an appropriate amount of the fortified micronutrients to contribute to the daily recommended intake. <br><br>d) High Fat, Sugar, Salt (HFSS) foods are excluded from Fortified Processed Foods category: This is correct. In many cases, HFSS foods, which are often considered less healthy due to their high content of fat, sugar, and salt, are not targeted for fortification.

    correct: "Steaming under 51b pressure in a retort",
    description: "c) Steaming under 51b pressure in a retort Steaming is a moist-heat cooking method where food is cooked by the heat of steam. The temperature of the steam is typically around 100°C. However, when steaming is done under pressure in a retort (a specialized high-pressure vessel used in food processing), the temperature of the steam can exceed 100°C. The internal temperature of the food being processed in a retort can go beyond 100°C.In the cooking method of steaming under 51b pressure in a retort, the internal temperature of the food can exceed 100°C. This is because the retort applies pressure, which raises the boiling point of water. As a result, the steam inside the retort reaches temperatures higher than the typical boiling point of 100° C (212° F). The elevated temperature helps to achieve proper sterilization and preservation of the food in the retort."
