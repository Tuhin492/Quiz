    answers: ["Seema asked him if he was happy.", "Seema asked him whether he is happy.", "Seema asked him if he were happy.", "Seema inquired him if he was happy."],

    description: "The given sentence is of ‘Direct Speech’. Direct Speech - Reporting the message of the speaker in the exact words as spoken by him. Indirect speech - Reporting the message of the speaker in our own words. While converting into ‘Indirect Speech’ we consider the following rules. The reporting verb “Said To’ changes to ‘Asked, Inquired’, The interrogative sentence is changed into a statement by placing the subject before the verb and the full stop is put at the end of the sentence. If the interrogative sentence is a ‘Yes-No Answer Type Sentence’ (with auxiliary verbs am, are, was, were, do, did, have, shall, etc), then ‘If or ‘Whether’ is used as a conjunction. The auxiliaries ‘Do, Does, Did’ in a positive question in the reported speech are dropped. The sentence thus formed is- Seema asked him if he was happy."
