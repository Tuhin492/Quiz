            description: "The correct option for the cause of rigor mortis is (c): Unavailability of ATP which is necessary to break the link between actin and myosin. Rigor mortis is the stiffening of muscles that occurs after death. It is a result of a series of biochemical reactions that take place in the muscles after death. When a person dies, the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the energy currency of cells, stops. ATP is required for the detachment of myosin (a protein) from actin (another protein) in the muscle fibers. During life, ATP is needed to fuel the sliding movement of actin and myosin, allowing muscles to contract and relax. However, after death, ATP production ceases, leading to a depletion of ATP reserves within the muscle cells. Without ATP, the myosin heads remain attached to the actin filaments, resulting in a state of sustained muscle contraction. This sustained contraction causes the muscles to become rigid and stiff, which is known as rigor mortis. Rigor mortis usually sets in within a few hours after death and peaks at around 12-24 hours. Over time, as the body undergoes decomposition, the rigidity of the muscles gradually diminishes. "

            description: "Explanation:The correct option for the enzyme system used for the removal of glucose from egg white prior to its drying is (c) Glucose oxidase and catalase. Glucose oxidase is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide. It specifically acts on glucose molecules. This enzyme is commonly used in various food and beverage industries, including the drying of egg white, to remove glucose and prevent browning reactions. Catalase, on the other hand, is an enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. In the presence of glucose oxidase, hydrogen peroxide is produced as a byproduct. The addition of catalase helps in the removal of hydrogen peroxide, which can be harmful to the egg white or other food products. So, the combined action of glucose oxidase and catalase efficiently removes glucose and prevents browning reactions by converting it into gluconic acid, water, and oxygen. "

            correct: "Calpain",
            description: "The correct option is (c) Calpain. Calpain is an enzyme that plays a major role in the postmortem degradation of muscle protein. It is a calcium - dependent protease that is naturally present in muscle cells. During the postmortem period, the lack of oxygen supply to the muscles leads to a series of biochemical changes, including the release of calcium ions from intracellular stores. The increased levels of calcium ions activate calpain, which then acts on various muscle proteins, including myofibrillar proteins. Calpain breaks down these proteins into smaller fragments, resulting in the tenderization and degradation of muscle tissue. This process is known as postmortem proteolysis. Calpain is specifically involved in the breakdown of muscle proteins during the early postmortem period. It acts on specific sites within the proteins, cleaving them into smaller peptides. This proteolytic activity contributes to the tenderization of meat but can also affect its texture and sensory characteristics. "

It has several health benefits, including promoting regular bowel movements, reducing the risk of certain diseases, and aiding in weight management. Let's go through each option to understand why tapioca starch is not classified as dietary fiber: (a) Agar - Agar is a type of gelatinous substance derived from seaweed. It is classified as dietary fiber because it is not digested by human enzymes and passes through the digestive system relatively intact. (b) Pectin - Pectin is a soluble fiber found in fruits and vegetables. It forms a gel-like substance in the digestive system and is considered a dietary fiber. (c) Sodium alginate - Sodium alginate is extracted from brown seaweed and is commonly used as a food additive. It is also classified as dietary fiber because it resists digestion and provides similar health benefits as other fibers. (d) Tapioca starch - Tapioca starch, also known as tapioca flour, is derived from the cassava plant. Unlike the other options, tapioca starch is not classified as dietary fiber. It consists mainly of starch, which is a complex carbohydrate made up of glucose molecules. Starch is digested by enzymes in the human body and broken down into glucose for energy. While tapioca starch may have some other nutritional properties, it does not possess the characteristics of dietary fiber."

Yeast is a microorganism that converts sugars into ethanol (alcohol) and carbon dioxide through the process of alcoholic fermentation. This is the same process used to produce alcoholic beverages like wine and beer.

The growth pattern can be expressed using logarithmic equations, such as the exponential growth equation: Nt = N0 * 2^(t/g), where: Nt is the final population size after time t. N0 is the initial population size (at time t = 0). t is the time in which the growth occurs. g is the generation time (the time it takes for the population to double).

This includes proper cleaning, sanitization, and sealing of containers to prevent the entry of microorganisms. By minimizing their initial presence, the growth of spoilage-causing microbes can be reduced. (b) Physical removal of micro-organisms: Certain food processing methods, such as washing, peeling, and filtration, can physically remove a significant number of microorganisms present on the food's surface. By doing so, the initial microbial load can be reduced, slowing down spoilage. (c) Hindering the activity of micro-organisms: Various techniques can hinder or slow down the growth and activity of microorganisms in food. Some common methods include refrigeration, freezing, drying, salting, pasteurization, and canning. These processes create conditions that are unfavorable for microbial growth, thereby extending the shelf life of the food. "

Raw meat, fish, poultry, and eggs can carry harmful bacteria, and if their juices come into contact with other foods, it can lead to the spread of these bacteria. By selecting these items last, you reduce the chances of contaminating other groceries in your shopping cart. (b) Do not purchase items in bulging or dented cans: Bulging or dented cans can be a sign of bacterial contamination or other issues with the food inside. Bacteria can produce gases that cause cans to bulge, and dents can compromise the integrity of the can, allowing bacteria to enter. It's crucial not to buy such cans to ensure the safety of the food contained within.

            description: "Explanation:The correct option is (b) The heat stability of milk is judged by COB. The COB test is for acid milk that is too acid, pH <5.8, or abnormal milk, e.g., colostrum milk or mastitis-affected milk. If acidity is increased to more than 0.2 percent, there is coagulation due to heat treatment, which is the result of dissociation of calcium caseinate salt."

            description: "Explanation:\u03B1-amylase activity in wheat flour is determined by Hagberg Falling Number. \u03B1-amylase: -  \u03B1-Amylase is the major digestive enzyme in saliva.  It hydrolyses a-1,4 glycosidic linkages in starch. Hagberg Falling Number: -  The measure of a specific enzyme, namely \u03B1-amylase.  This enzyme attacks the starch molecules, breaking them down to sugars which then produce the gas giving the air pockets and good loaf structure.  \u03B1 -amylase levels need to be low to limit starch breakdown and dough stickiness.  A high Hagberg falling number is an indication of low a-amylase activity and thus good protein for baking."
